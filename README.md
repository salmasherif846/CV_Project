# QR Code Decoding using Classical Computer Vision Algorithms

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust and reliable image-processing pipeline for decoding QR codes using classical computer vision algorithms. It serves as a practical application of concepts discussed in Computer Vision lectures, enhancing students' understanding of real-life problem-solving in this field.

## Project Description
The main objective is to implement a QR code decoder following the ISO/IEC 18004 standard. The project covers the following key topics:
- Robust image preprocessing techniques.
- Adaptive image enhancement and noise attenuation methods.
- QR code frame extraction via morphological operations and Hough transform.
- Geometric transformations for QR code frame straightening.
- Manual QR decoding without machine learning or external libraries.

Emphasis is placed on understanding and applying classical computer vision algorithms to implement a widely used standard like QR codes.
